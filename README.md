# Optimizer
Contains an optimization module as well as codes for fitness functions for single crystal nanoindentation simulations using MSC-Marc and DAMASK.

Also added with this are objective function codes to get fitness for spectral solver in DAMASK and DAMASK-Mentat simulation

# Updates
Now the module also supports usage of Abaqus (abq) with DAMASK 2.0.
